# tkinter-blackjack
A-Level Coursework

Made the Blackjack card game in python using the Tkinter library
Supports multiple users through a sign-in window
Saves the current money of individual users in text files
Plays cool sound effects and music if pygame is installed

Not the best work ever, should have used classes but it's my first ever substantial project
